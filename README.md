# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

Throughout this course, I was challenged with the task of learning C++, as well as the different data models the language uses in its application. The task was to create a program for ABC University to help with accessing course information with students. In order to do this efficiently, I had to look into each data model to know how they differ from each other, as well the proper scenario to use them. After all, for an efficient program, this requires to know which data set has the shortest/longest time performing tasks, as well as how easy it is to format them. This involved a lot of taking use to, considering I was learning C++ alongside these complex ideas, but through a lot of outside research and trial and error, I was able to pull through and decided that the Binary Tree was the ideal data set for the task. Writing pseudocode also greatly benefitted me and my approach in designing software, as before while I only did it occasionally, having to write pseudocode definitely made the process go faster and made me hit less roadblocks due to the nature of preplanning. And although I have a long way to go with writing and documenting my code, I have made massive improvements over my previous projects.
